Login and Registering users with authentication

Website Structure for Authentication
The website structure is simple. It includes a homepage with two buttons: one to register and another to log in. Once a user has registered or logged in and been authenticated, they gain access to a secrets page.

The rest of the website remains minimal to focus on the complex topic of authentication.

Authentication is essential for associating user-generated data with individual accounts.
Users sign up with a username and password to uniquely identify themselves in the database.
